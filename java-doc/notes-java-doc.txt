* You can run the javadoc tool on entire packages, individual source files, or both. 
* When documenting entire packages, you can use the -subpackages option either to recursively traverse a directory and its subdirectories, or to pass in an explicit list of package names. 
* When you document individual source files, pass in a list of Java source file names.
* GNU-style options (that is, those beginning with --) can use an equal sign (=) instead of whitespace characters to separate the name of an option from its value.
