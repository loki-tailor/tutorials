### COURSE #1 : Setting Foundation of Successful Automation:
--------------------------------------------------------------------

#2: Desigining a Tets Strategy:
----------------------------------
    * What to automate? Regression? Smoke? Sanity?
    * 
        - Write TC.
        - Monitor Results
        - Update Tests

#ch:3 - Developing of Test Automatability
---------------------------------------------------

    * Test Automation Pyramid:
        top: UI
        mid: services
        down: uint

    * UI Tests:
        a. looks the way it should
        b. behaves the way it should

    * UI Automation Suggestions:
        - **Bifurciate tests as much as possible**
        - e.g. don't include "Test add to cart is working or not" with "Search product and then add to cart"
        - above can be separate tests as: "search product" & "add to card" hence the later does not have dependency on another functionalty other than "add to cart"
        - Use Seams: Shortcuts within an application, which makes application-testing (UI) much easier
            - e.g. unique URLs for various pages
            - or webs-services to perform some actions
            - **use seams as oppose to navigating at different places via click-streams**
        - Leading cause of flaky or unstable tests: absence of reliable identifiers

#ch: 4 - Tooling for Test Automation:
---------------------------------------------------

    * Interaction Level
    * Validation Level

    - Unit Tests: same as production code programming language
    - Service Level Tests: API / Webservices / HTTP Calls 
    - UI Level: Navigation Library / ability to interact with UI
    - Validation Library: pass/fail the tests
    - Reporting Library: screenshot or videos
    - Specification-Driven: Cucumber
    - CI: Jenkins, Azure

#ch: 5 - Future Proofing Test Automation Efforts
---------------------------------------------------

    - Running in Parallel
        - **no tests dependent on one another**
        - independent tests
        - **setup/clean-up should be isolated in tests itself**
        - modifying test-data that other tests may rely on
        - objects/variables declared/used by multiple threads: should be used in a thread-safe manner (shouldn't be global / static, as their values may change)
        - clean code:
            - avoid code duplication
            - long classes & methods
            - inefficient waiting within the tests
            - code smells (other bad practices)
        - design patterns: e.g. POM, ScreenPlay, Fluid, Builder, Singleton, Factory, Facade (some are alternatives to each other)

#ch: 6 - Scaling your test autoamtion
---------------------------------------------------

    - multiple-environments
        - ip, credentials, db details
        - use properties files
        - managing test-data for cross-multiple environments
        - containerization help mitigate some of these burden
    - multiple browsers
    - multiple devices

#ch: 7 - Measuring the value of your test automation
---------------------------------------------------------
    - Avoid unexpected expectations
    - Identify expectations early
    - shortened regression timings
    - frequent feedback (fast tests)
    - scability
