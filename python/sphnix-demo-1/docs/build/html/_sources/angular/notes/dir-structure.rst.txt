dir structure info
===========================

.. list-table:: 
  :align: left

  * - dir or file
    - desc

  * - angular.json 
    - | contains default for build, serve, lint, test tools
      | typically don't need to add anything in this file unless something extra is needed

        .. list-table:: 
          :align: left

          * - attribute
            - desc

          * - $.projects { ... }
            - | contains multiple projects
              | used when mono-repo maintainence is required

          * - $.projects.myapp.architect.build { ... }
            - | files from where the app needs to be rendered 
              | ``index.html``: components, views, etc.. 
              | ``main.ts``: driver class from where bootstrap the app
              | ``polyfills.ts``: involved when browser not supports latest ECMAScript
              | ``tsconfig.app.json``: typescript configuration file
              | ``aot``: `ahead of time` - compiler strategy used by angular
              | ``assets []``: contains files to render as it is e.g. images i.e. static data
              | ``style.scss []``: file path for scss 

          * - $.projects.myapp.architect.test { ... }
            - | details of unit tests to be executed
              | ``test.ts``: main file for tests
              | ``tsconfig.spec.json``: config file

  * - package.json
    - | **important file**: contains the project wide NPM dependencies. 
      | A ``dependencies`` can either be essential to running an app like angulare core libraries, RxJS, zone.js, etc..
      | or merely a ``devDependencies`` like the CLI, linting tools, testing frameworks
      | which may not be needed to bundled to deploy an application in production
      |
      | ``npm install xxx`` searches in ``package.json`` first to check if it's the package is installed or not
      | "rxjs": "~7.5.0", // imp for async programming
      | "zone.js": "~0.11.4" // used for chain detection mechanisim for angular

  * - package-lock.json
    - | **huge file**, not recommended to edit manually
      | detailed version specific information for the dependencies
      | this is auto-generated when ``npm install`` is run
      | like freezing the libs and versions

  * - tscofig.json
    - | TypeScript configuration at the workspace level.
      | applications may have their own configs which inherit this fill as a base for TS configs
      | ``$.compilerOptions.outDir`` = location where ``.js`` files will be stored
      | default value @ "outDir": "./dist/out-tsc"
      | ``target`` = ECMAScript versions
      | ``strict`` = strict checking during compiling
      | this is extended by ``tsconfig.app.json``
      |
      | if you lost the this file somehow
      | then it can be generated as -> ``tsc --init``

  * - tslint.json
    - provides linting tool for code standards

  * - karma.conf.js
    - | runner used for unit tests

  * - node_modules/
    - | all node dependencies which are fetched are stored in this folder
      | common across the workspace
      | **never commit or share this folder. size is HUGE**

  * - e2e/
    - | e2e tests from source app
      | file where all the automation tests will go      

  * - src/
    - | the source folder that contains the main application (components, services, etc...)

**src/ folder structure info**

.. list-table:: 
  :align: left

  * - sub-folder / sub-files
    - desc

  * - app/
    - | application details
      | contains root modules + other modules + their components
      |
      | inside this folder we can have sub-folders for other components 
      | 
      | for each component:
      | - \***-component.html    = rendered on UI, like container for all other individual components
      | - \***-component.scss    = stylesheet for particular component
      | - \***-component.spec.ts = unit tests for that component
      | - \***-component.ts      = TypeScript file where main logic will be written 
      | - \***-module.ts         = ___________________
      | - \***-routing.module.ts = ___________________

  * - assets/
    - | application specific assets.
      | files which we want to keep as-is
      | static-data files

  * - environments/
    - maintaining only a constant

  * - favicon.ico
    - the browser title icon

  * - index.html
    - | contain all other HTML files (even the app-component.html)
      | this is sort-of stating SPA
      | only this file has ``<html>`` tag

  * - ``main.ts``
    - | starting point which will bootstrap the root module
      | root component will hold the hierarchy of all other component
      | ``main.ts``: changes are rarely done in this. starting point for application
      | ``main.ts``: like a ``public static void main(String[] args) { .. }``
      |
      | ``main.ts: platformBrowserDynamic().bootstrapModule(AppModule).catch(err => console.error(err));``: 
      | *above*: root module / parament of all modules / main module under which all other will be called
      | *above*: ``AppModule`` will be started/loaded first when app is started      

  * - ``polyfill.ts``
    - | browser support for cross ECMAScript versions

  * - ``style.scss``
    - global styling (rarely this will be done)

  * - ``test.ts``
    - | similary ``main.ts`` but for unit tests
      | starting point for unit tests
      | command = ``ng test``
