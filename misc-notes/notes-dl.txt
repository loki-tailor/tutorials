deep-learning

* Using Neural Networks to train x for doing smart task, it might fall under DL
* PyTorch by FB
* TensorFlow by Google

* DL needs large amount of  data to work efficiently
* DL algo are highly dependent on hardware machines (since requirement of GPU is required, since large amountof matrix operations are done)
* In DL, it tries to learn high-level feature from the data
* Reduces the task of new feature extractor
* DL takes long time to get trained
* time reduces as data increases
