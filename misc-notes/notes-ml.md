>> I don't know. Excel is a very trivial thing. ML is not. 
1. You need tons of data (where do you get this for your specific problem) 
2. Lets assume you have the data, you still have to train it, which is also not trivial
3. You have to make sure that your application runs correctly, which is not easy because your NN output is unpredictable

So if you have a serious problem, then ML can offer a solution, however implementing this is not easy. Maybe there are some problems which are already solved by pre-trained models and you can use them (those will increase over time), then you are lucky and it's probably simple to implement. However everything that you have to train for yourself is definitely not on the same level as exel'

>> Tools and tecnologies to 1- generate data, 2- train optimization and 3- NN analysis are the natural and probably the first things to become trivial....

>> I absolutely agree with you. From my experience toward my research, machine learning is only useful if there is data available to extract features. However, if you are extracting features from unknown observation then model-based approach is very useful. These days a hybrid between model-based approach and machine learning techniques are useful

>> ML (Stastical Models) = DL + something else 
something_else:
    - Decision Tree
    - Support Vector Machine
    - Linear Regression Single Variable
    - K-Means Clustering
>> ML don't necessairly have to use NN, can use Statistical Algos only (TBC)
>>  ML:
    - Supervised learning
    - Unsupervised learning
    - Clustering
>> ML is part of AI

* Implementing ML enables taking data-driven decisions
* ML algorithms can be easily implemented on smaller scales
* Can  work on low-end machines

* Perofrmance depends on how accurately the features are identified and extracted
* takes lesser time to get trained
* test-time increases as size of data increases
